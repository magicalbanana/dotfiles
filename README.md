# dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles I use for my dev machines (personal or
work).

## NVIM config

It is worth noting that the my NVIM configuration is heavily inspired [akinsho's
config](https://github.com/akinsho/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/nvim) which after
many iterations, proved to be better than what I had before.
